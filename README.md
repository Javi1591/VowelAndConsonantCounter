# ArraysAndVectors

A C++ console application project designed to demonstrate working with arrays and vectors. Built using Visual Studio (or your preferred C++ IDE), this assignment encompasses declaring and manipulating one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, performing operations on `std::vector`, and using loops and functions for data processing.

---

## Project Overview

This project covers the following core tasks:

- Declaring and initializing one-dimensional arrays.
- Declaring and initializing two-dimensional arrays.
- Using `std::vector` to dynamically handle collections of data.
- Generating random values to populate arrays and vectors.
- Calculating totals, averages, minimums, and maximums using loops and function calls.
- Displaying the data in formatted output for clarity.

---

## Features

- Prompt user for the size (or number of elements) for the one-dimensional vector or array.
- Populate the data structure with random numbers (or user‐provided input) within a set range.
- Compute and display:
  - Total sum of elements.
  - Average of elements.
  - Minimum and maximum values.
- For two-dimensional arrays:
  - Populate a row-by-row structure.
  - Calculate row totals, column totals, and overall totals.
  - Display the structure in a table format.
- Validate user input to avoid invalid array/vector sizes or out‐of‐range values.

## Technologies Used

- Language: C++ (compatible with C++11 or later)  
- IDE: Visual Studio (2019/2022) or any environment supporting C++ development  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need a system with a C++ compiler (Visual Studio preferred) and basic familiarity with C++ basics—arrays, loops, functions, vectors.
